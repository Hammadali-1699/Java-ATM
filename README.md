# Java-ATM
This project is a Java-based ATM Simulation System developed in my 1st semester as a beginner-level programming project. It is a console application that demonstrates basic banking operations and core programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, arrays, and user input handling.

📌 Features

The ATM system provides the following functionalities:

🔐 User Login Authentication (PIN & Username)

💰 Withdraw Money (Preset and Custom Amount)

💵 Deposit Money

📊 Check Account Balance

🔄 Transfer Money Between Users

🚪 Exit Option

👥 Predefined Users

The system contains some predefined users with initial balances:

User	PIN	Balance
Burair	1234	100000
Hammad	1111	50000
Afnan	2222	65000
Anoosha	4444	80000
